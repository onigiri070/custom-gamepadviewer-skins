- Dpad
- ABXY
- Shoulder buttons

## SNES
SVG skin for SNES display.

### Issue with wrong mapping
Some controllers do not map buttons correctly in the CLR Browser plugin. The
`ibuffalo-map-skin.css` is an alternative SNES skin that maps the buttons
*wrong* so it's displayed correctly in the CLR browser. If this does not work,
use window capture with the regular skin.

## F710
Skin for the F710 display.

# Roadmap:
- SVG for F710.
